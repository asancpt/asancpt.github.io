- Potential of a DSB (Double-Strand Break)
    - CRISPR/Cas9
    - Argonaute
    - Non-homologous end joining (Frequency 10-50%)
    - Finding the most promising therapeutic application - desired genetic outcome, cell type, delivery method (Difficult!)
    - HSV-1 (Cornea) CAR-T (Destroying TCR and CD52)
- Power of Gene Addition
    - Efficiency vs precision
- DSB vs Retrovirus vs Transposon
    - Retro/Transposon - lack DNA sequence spec
    - site-specific recombinases - all-in-one enzyme
        - cre resolvase
        - cas9
